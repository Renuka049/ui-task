# Ticket Management — Frontend Demo

A small static frontend for a simple ticket management UI. Open `index.html` in a browser to use the app.

**Files**
- `index.html`: Entry page / navigation for the app.
- `add-ticket.html`: Form for creating a new ticket (title, description, priority, etc.).
- `tickets.html`: List view of all tickets with actions (view, edit, delete).
- `dashboard.html`: Summary and visual overview (counts, basic stats) of tickets.
- `main.js`: Client-side JavaScript that handles form submission, UI updates, and persistence (e.g., localStorage).
- `style.css`: Global styles for layout, colors, and responsive behavior.

**How to run**
- Open `index.html` in a web browser. No server required for basic usage.

**Development**
- Edit `main.js` and the HTML files; reload the browser to see changes.
- If you add package tooling or a build step later, include instructions here.

**Notes**
- This is a static frontend project; persistence is typically implemented in `main.js` using browser storage.

**Author**
- Created for a small demo workspace.
